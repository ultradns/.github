> UltraDNS's template for open source community resources

This repository contains shared community resources that will propagate to all public repositories in the UltraDNS organization that don't already have their own resource that fills this purpose.

## What's included

- **Code of Conduct**: Guidelines for respectful and inclusive participation
- **Contributing Guidelines**: How to contribute to UltraDNS open source projects
- **Security Policy**: How to report security vulnerabilities
- **Issue Templates**: Standardized templates for bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Request Template**: Guidelines for submitting code changes

## How it works

GitHub automatically applies these community resources to repositories in the UltraDNS organization that don't have their own versions. This ensures consistency across all our open source projects while allowing individual repositories to customize when needed.

You can learn more about this GitHub feature in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
